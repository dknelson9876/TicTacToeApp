Tic Tac Toe App

Currently based around a Canvas that everything gets drawn on, this is a side project I'm doing
to help me improve what I know about Android.

The game starts with X going first, and alternates back and forth,
each next tap being the other side (X or O) until either one player
gets three in a row, or the board is filled.

Toast messages are used to notify the players of when a result is reached,
And that tapping anywhere will reset the board.
